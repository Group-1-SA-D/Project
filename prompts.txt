OpenHands:

Create a basic ExpressJS eCommerce template, and add a landing page and shopping cart.

Can you update all of the button components so that they are red and a slightly darker red on hover?

Can you ensure all of the buttons on all of the pages match?

I don't know why, but some of the images aren't loading now.

A few things:

- I notice the "Add to cart" button is brighter than the "View Products" and similar buttons on the landing page. I like the slightly muted colors of the ones on the landing page. Can you change these all to match?

- The limited edition hoodie is missing from the special offers page. The special offers page also does not work with the shopping cart.

- When clicked, the buttons are blue for a split second. I think the "clicked" color should be black.

If you could fix all of these, that would be super.

The cart buttons are still the brighter red.

Special offers are still not something I can add to the cart. Can you fix this?

Can you implement an SQLite database backend for this app?

Can you clean up the extra files from testing and ensure the project is organized sensibly?

Do we actually need sequelize?

Void/DeepSeek:

Add placeholder product info for a university merch store.

Add a customer service page.

Add a special offers page.

Add sets of images to the bundles on the offers page.

Add demo functionality so that items can be added to the cart. This will eventually be integrated into a database, but this is just demo functionality for now.

I got this error when I tried to add something to the cart.

Make it so that you can remove items from the cart.
