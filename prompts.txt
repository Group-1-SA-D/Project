OpenHands:

Create a basic ExpressJS eCommerce template, and add a landing page and shopping cart.

Can you update all of the button components so that they are red and a slightly darker red on hover?

Can you ensure all of the buttons on all of the pages match?

I don't know why, but some of the images aren't loading now.

A few things:

- I notice the "Add to cart" button is brighter than the "View Products" and similar buttons on the landing page. I like the slightly muted colors of the ones on the landing page. Can you change these all to match?

- The limited edition hoodie is missing from the special offers page. The special offers page also does not work with the shopping cart.

- When clicked, the buttons are blue for a split second. I think the "clicked" color should be black.

If you could fix all of these, that would be super.

The cart buttons are still the brighter red.

Special offers are still not something I can add to the cart. Can you fix this?

Can you implement an SQLite database backend for this app?

Can you clean up the extra files from testing and ensure the project is organized sensibly?

Do we actually need sequelize?

Flux Schnell:

Professional product photo of a [insert item] on a white background, red and white, FSU text, product photo, DSLR photography

Void/DeepSeek:

Add placeholder product info for a university merch store.

Add a customer service page.

Add a special offers page.

Add sets of images to the bundles on the offers page.

Add demo functionality so that items can be added to the cart. This will eventually be integrated into a database, but this is just demo functionality for now.

I got this error when I tried to add something to the cart.

Make it so that you can remove items from the cart.

Can you configure a basic database in this project using sqlite3?

It's immedately crashing when I run npm start.

It's running now, but my browser connection is being refused.

I can't access the website when this project is running. Can you fix this?

Can you fix it? It still is an issue.

I see this at that localhost address, but where is the rest of the express site?

None of the add to cart buttons work.

The remove button on the cart page does not work.

Can you list all of the prompts I prompted you with and add them to the Void section of prompts.txt?

Void/DeepSeek:

1. "can you update the checkout process to where it asks for basic payment information and then gives you an order confirmation screen after"
2. "can you add a shipping address as well for the checkout"
3. "its still happening. What I mean is when you click add to cart on the store page dont open up the info page for the item. Only open up the info page for an item if you click on the name or picture of an item"
4. "the cart amount is still saying 0 when on the home page and customer service page after I add an item to the cart"
5. "can you remove the item added to cart alert when adding an item to your cart on the special offers page"
6. "add these prompts to prompts.txt under the void/deepseek heading"
